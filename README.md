# CheatSheets
Markdown Cheat Sheets for various subjects hosted on iBaguette.com/cheatsheets!

# Where do I see them?
Go to https://ibaguette.com/cheatsheets.

Alternatively:
- Navigate into the tier's folder at `/GCSE` or `/ A level` to see the HTML files or download them.
- Markdown files are in each of the tiers' folders at `/md` which can then be edited in somethink like StackEdit. GitHub also does an alright job at rendering the overall format too!

# How do I see changes?
You can click on the Commit History button to see recent changes or go to a file and click its commit history to see that.

# Where are the images?
- Images are currently spread around on multiple sites
- This may be from Discord, some alternate sites and some on my own webserver. (Thanks to my server members for boosting the server and allowing for this!)

In the future, they will all be hosted on a Replit webserver which you can see at https://replit.com/@Draggie/cheatsheet-assets
