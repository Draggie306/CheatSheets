# Where do I see them?

## step 1: easy mode
Simply go to [ibaguette.com/cheatsheets](https://ibaguette.com/cheatsheets) or click that link to browse through the wealth of resources in a new tab.

## or, alternatively:
- Navigate into the tier's folder at `/GCSE` or `/A level` to see the HTML files or download them.
- Markdown files are in each of the tiers' folders at `/source` which can then be edited in something like StackEdit. GitHub also does a good job at rendering the them too, but some functionality is not there!
- In each tier, there is an `index.html` file. This is what is served when you want are choosing the cheat sheet you want.
- Now includes other format

# Can I trust iBaguette's Cheat Sheets?
iBaguette.com's source code is available at my other repository, [Draggie306/iBaguette](https://github.com/Draggie306/iBaguette). Additionally, the source code is avaiable right on this page.
You can find additional information regarding the history of the site and features, as well as information from educators and students alike, with proven exam results and testimonials available on [this blog post that I wrote](https://www.ibaguette.com/2023/04/what-is-iBaguette.html). You can ask other students and educators in the [Baguette Brigaders Discord server](https://discord.gg/xz4SjyuBND) if you have any questions or concerns.


# How do I see changes?
You can click on the Commit History button to see recent changes or go to a file and click its commit history to see that.


# Where are the images?
- Images are currently spread around on multiple sites, primarily using Discord's CDN
- There are some images linked to other sites and some on my own webserver. (Thanks to the amazing Baguette Brigaders server members for boosting the server and allowing for this!)

In the future, they will all be hosted on a Replit webserver which you can see at https://replit.com/@Draggie/cheatsheet-assets
Update: probably not, there is now an egress limit on Replit.
Update 2: I'm gradually migrating things over to this, with Cloudflare proxying the images.
