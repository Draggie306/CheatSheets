## step 1: easy mode
Simply go to [ibaguette.com/cheatsheets](https://ibaguette.com/cheatsheets) or click that link to browse through the wealth of resources in a new tab.

## or, alternatively:
- Navigate into the tier's folder at `/GCSE` or `/A level` to see the HTML files or download them.
- Markdown files are in each of the tiers' folders at `/source` which can then be edited in something like StackEdit. GitHub also does a good job at rendering the them too, but some functionality is not there!
