# FAQ
## Can I trust iBaguette's Cheat Sheets?
The revision resources here are completely independent and made with no affiliation to any organisation or motive. I (a Computer Science student at a Russell Group uni, who achieved A\*A\*AA at A Level and 99999988887 at GCSE) simply enjoy making and publishing the resources that I wish I had for revision.

### From a pedagogical standpoint
I write all my Cheat Sheets and revision resources by hand, fact-checking and adding information from a range of resources to produce the best material possible with minimal errors. Should mistakes be found, I take them very seriously and will rectify them as soon as I am notified.

Revision material is regularly reviewed, consolidated and clarified to improve understanding and overall quality. I also make regular comparisions to the respective exam specifications, integrating changes as soon as I can.

### From a security standpoint

iBaguette.com's source code is available at my other repository, [Draggie306/iBaguette](https://github.com/Draggie306/iBaguette). Additionally, the source code is avaiable right on this page. All written material on the website is included in this repository above.
